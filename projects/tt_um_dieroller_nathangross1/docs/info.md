## How it works

Takes binary input die size from user and generates a random number from 1-die_size when input to roll is received. Uses clock counter for random number.

## How to test

Select die size with inputs 0-6, see that die size is displaying. roll die with input 7 repeatedly, noting random numbers from 1 to die size.

## External hardware

- PMOD output splitter
- PMOD dual 7-segment display
