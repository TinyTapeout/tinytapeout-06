## How it works

The project is a hardware implementation of the Trivium stream cipher used as a non-linear feedback shift register (NLFSR). The NLFSR is defined with the least-significant bit (LSB) at the left-most register R0 and the most-significant bit (MSB) at the right-most register R287. The LFSR circular shifts bits from left to right (R_n -> R_n+1), with the three feedback taps:

R177 = (R174 * R175) + (R161 + R176) + R263
R93 = (R90 * R91) + (R65 + R92) + R170
R0  = (R285 * R286) + (R242 + R287) + R68

The output of the NLFSR is:

z   = R65 + R92 + R161 + R176 + R242 + R287

The NLFSR contains an initialization/fail-safe feedback that prevents the LFSR from entering an all-zero state. If the LFSR is ever in an all-zero state, a "1" value is inserted into R0.

A schematic of the circuit may be found at:

<https://wokwi.com/projects/395357890431011841>

The circuit has 10 inputs:

| Input    | Setting                     |
| -------- | -------                     |
| CLK      | Clock                       |
| RST_N    | Not Used                    |
| 01       | Not Used                    |
| 02       | Manual R0 Input Value       |
| 03       | Input Select                |
| 04       | Not Used                    |
| 05       | Not Used                    |
| 06       | Not Used                    |
| 07       | Not Used                    |
| 08       | Not Used                    |

The CLK sets the clocking for the flip-flop registers for latching the NLFSR values. In the schematic shown in the Wokwi project, a switch is used to select either the system clock or an externally provided or manual clock that allows the user to manually step through each latching event.

An 8-input DIP switch provides some flexibility to initalizing the NLFSR. DIP03 (IN2) allows the user to toggle the Input Select function, which is a multiplexer that select whether the left-most register (R0) takes in as the input the NLFSR feedback value or a value that is manually selected by the user. The switch also controls whether R93 and R177 takes in a NLFSR feedback or a value directly from R92 or R176, respectively.

DIP02 (IN1) allows a the user to manually enter a 0 or a 1 value into the leftmost register.

The cicuit has 8 outputs. They output the following values:

| Output   | Value in    |
| -------- | -------     |
| 01       | R0  (NLFSR input)|
| 02       | R65 |
| 03       | R92 |
| 04       | R161 |
| 05       | R176 |
| 06       | R242 |
| 07       | R287 |
| 08       | z (NLFSR output) |

The output allows for some self-testing, where OUT08 = OUT02 + OUT03 + OUT04 + OUT05 + OUT06 + OUT07.

## How to test

The circuit can be tested by powering on the circuit, and first setting the Input Select switch (DIP03) to "1" to reset/initialize the entire LFSR to all-zeros. The Input Select switch can then be switched to "0" to allow the LFSR to run from its all-zero initialized value. The output values of the NLFSR from this zeroized state may be observed using a logic analyzer, and can be compared with the values obtained for the python simulation:
