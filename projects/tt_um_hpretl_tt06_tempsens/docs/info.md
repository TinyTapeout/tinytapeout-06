## How it works

There will be a better explanation in the future. In short, it measures the on-chip temperature, and puts out the result.

## How to test

Simply turn it on, and see the result. IO usage documented in the `info.yml`.

For direct outside control (bypassing the internal measurement state machine), use the following settings:

- Set `uio_in[3:0] = 0b1111` (enable debug mode 15).
- Set the DAC by using `ui_in[5:0]` (6b direct control of `tempsens_dat[5:0]`).
- `ui_in[6]` is connected to `tempsens_enable`.
- `ui_in[7]` is connected to `tempsens_prechrgn`.
- The output of the temperature sensor `tempsens_tempdelay` is connected to `uio_out[4]`.
- Use the `clk` input to synchronize the temperature output of falling edge.

## External hardware

Requires a logic analyzer or similar to inspect the digital outputs.
