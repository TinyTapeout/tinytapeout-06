## How it works

This is a very simple circuit, it consists in two LSFR register lineary connecated in an specific way in order to generate two m-sequences, in order to 
generate this pair of m-sequences, we input an initial vaule called seed, this is because we cannot generate a PN signal if the LSFR registers have an 
initial value of 0s. For this design we used two LSFR with 5 D Flip-Flops. With this we can generate a PN signal with a length of(2^5)-1.
With this PN signal and modulus 2 adding the signal we want to tranmit, we generate a CDMA signal, which we are going to study simulating a channel with
an OPAM in order to add noise to the CDMA and feed it back to the designed circuit to see the bit-error rate of this device.

With this we hope to study and put to test:
- CDMA
- Gold Sequences.
- The effect of the noise in the CDMA.
- Reception process with a simulated channel.
- Apply the knowledge aquired within the Latinpractice Bootcamp initiative and apply the knowledge to design and print in a silicon wafer the proposed device.

## How to test

As we used a hardware description language (Verilog), we created an specific testbench for the cdma.v, this testbench simply initializes the input signals
to 0 in order to generate the adequate signal such as the clock, a test signal to send that lasts 31 clock cycles (Spread-spectrum), a seed value to load both LSFR
The stimulus simple will assign a value to set_i and deactivate it to load the seed, after that, the LSFR have a linear feedback and will contantly generate the Gold signal
each clock cycle. With the test signal_i we the system will generate the CDMA signal and assign it to CDMA_o, the Gold signal is assigned to Gold_o, this is the tranmition process.

For the reception process, we simply assign the value of CDMA_o to receptor_i and the output will be observerd at receptor_o, we can observe that we recovered signal_i as 
it shows the same time diagram as receptor_o.

As for the LED_o it works as a simple indicator that the inputed seed is valid for transmission.

The template will include the verilog file with its testbench.
