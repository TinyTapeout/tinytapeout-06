## How it works

This project implements 9 programmable digital recurrent LIF neurons. The neurons are arranged in 3 layers (3 in each). Spikes_in directly maps to the inputs of the first layer neurons. When an input spike is received, it is first multiplied by an 8 bit weight, programmable from a custom interface, 1 per input neuron. This 8 bit value is then added to the membrane potential of the respective neuron. 
When the first layer neurons activate, its pulse is routed to each of the 3 neurons in the next layer.
There are 9x3 programmable weights describing the connectivity between the input spikes and the first layer (9 weights=3x3), the first and second layers (9 weights=3x3), and second and third layers (9 weights=3x3).
Output spikes from the 3nd layer drive spikes_out. 


## How to test

After reset, program the neuron threshold, leak rate, feedback_scale and refractory period.
Additionally program the first, 2nd, 3rd layer weights. Once programmed activate spikes_in to represent input data, track spikes_out synchronously (1 clock cycle pulses). 


## Memory

The memory block stores 39 words of 8 bits. 
The first 12 words represent Feedback scale, Refractory Period, Decay rate, Membrane Threshold of each layer ( 4 parameters x 3 layers ).
The last 27 words represent the network weights ( 3 ins x 3 neurons x 3 layers ).
