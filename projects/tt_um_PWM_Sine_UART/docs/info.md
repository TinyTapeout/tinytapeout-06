## How it works

Through UART communication, a number from 1 to 7 is sent, indicating the frequencies set in the code, which are from 100 Hz to 700 Hz, then through a pin I generate a PWM signal which varies in time to generate a sine wave of the frequency that was requested.

## How to test

Only physical tests were carried out with the circuit, a Bluetooth antenna was added to the UART communication port, and a low pass filter was added to the output of the system to improve the signal a little and then it was measured with the oscilloscope and I verify that it delivers the requested frequencies.

## External hardware

- Bluetooth HC05
- Oscilloscope
- A low pass filter
