## How it works

The project was originated during the training class, "ChipCraft: The Art of Chip Design for Non-Experts" presented by eFabless.

The project utilizes techniques associated with Tiny Tapeout and Redwood EDA.

This Project is a 'simple' project for inexperienced FPGA and/or inexperienced Verilog programmers. The project reads the INPUT DIP Switch on the Tiny Tapeout Demo Board and outputs the properly formatted Hex character, to the 7-Segment display which is also located on the Tiny Tapeout Demo Board.

The complete Transaction-Level Verilog code is located in the file, "DIPSwitch_7-segment.v"

The remainder of this README.md file outlines the process utilized for this project.

## How to test

Select a HEX character from 1 to 16 (1 to F).  Input the HEX character by using the appropriate binary value, using the DIP Switch. The HEX character you selected and input will be displayed on the 7-segment display.
