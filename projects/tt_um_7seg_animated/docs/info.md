## How it works

Animates the 7-segment display by reading in the input switches to create a custom 7-segment character. Nothing will be displayed until you toggle input 7 to start the character animation sequence.

Inputs 0 through 6 map to outputs 0 though 6 (display segments a through g). Output 7 becomes active while input 7 is active.

The uio inputs are used for an experimental pwm dimming feature, to enable pwm display dimming, set uio pin 7 active. uio inputs 0 through 6 set a 7-bit pwm dimming value on an 8-bit pwm unit. The pwm lsb input is tied to 0.

The circuit works by iterating over the character bit pattern, enabling segments sequentially at a speed of about 0.12 seconds per segment.

## How to test

Toggle the input switches to create a character with inputs 0-6, toggle input 7 to start the character animation sequence.

Optionally dim the display by enabling the pwm feature described above.
