## How it works

The 16-bit calculator looks in a simplified symbolic schematic as follows:

![Simplified schematic of the calculator](images/1.png)

You have an IO-Port (8-bit) to load data to registers for the operands A and B for the calculation operation as well as to output the result of the alu operation. The IN[3:0] are used for the alu operation selection (there are 12 different operations possible). The CLK is the clock and RST_N is the reset pin. There are also OUT[4:0] which shows the status of the alu operation as well as the OUT[7:5] to see at which step the whole operation is.

To better clarify how it works, there is a timing diagram:

- As long as the RST_N pin is low, the counter is reset and nothing happens.
- If RST_N is HIGH then the operation starts.
- At a negative CLK edge the counter increments and gets 1. At the following positive CLK edge whatever is on the IO-Port gets loaded into the low-byte of operand A (at the next negative CLK edge the counter increments).
- At Counter=2 and POS EDGE CLK: IO-Port data gets loaded into High-Byte of A.
- At Counter=3 and POS EDGE CLK: IO-Port data gets loaded into Low-Byte of B.
- At Counter=4 and POS EDGE CLK: IO-Port data gets loaded into High-Byte of B. Additionally, the ALU Operation gets selected.
- At Counter=5 and POS EDGE CLK: The result of the ALU operation is on the IO-Port (Low-Byte of result), and the Status of the ALU-Operation is updated at the Status output.
- At Counter=6 and POS EDGE CLK: The high-Byte of the ALU operation is on the IO-Port.
- At the following NEG EDGE CLK, the Counter will restart from zero (the same happens if RST_N gets low during the operation).

The following alu operations are possible:

| ALU Op Select | Operation  | Name of Operation      |
|---------------|------------|------------------------|
| 0             | R=0        | Null Operation         |
| 1             | R=~A       | Inverse of A           |
| 2             | R=A<<1     | Shift left A           |
| 3             | R=A>>1     | Shift right A          |
| 4             | R=rot_l(A) | Rotate left A          |
| 5             | R=rot_r(A) | Rotate right A         |
| 6             | R=A+1      | Increment A            |
| 7             | R=A-1      | Decrement A            |
| 8             | R=A and B  | Bitwise A and B        |
| 9             | R=A or B   | Bitwise A or B         |
| 10            | R=A xor B  | Bitwise A xor B        |
| 11            | R=A+B      | Addition of A and B    |
| 12            | R=A-B      | Subtraction of A and B |

The status out register is as follows:

| Status Register | Flag                      | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bit 0           | Wrong Operation Flag (WF) | Set when ALU Op Select is 13,14 or 15 (there is no operation). |
| Bit 1           | Zero Flag (ZF)            | Set when result is zero.                                       |
| Bit 2           | Sign Flag (SF)            | Set when the highest bit (bit 15) is 1.                        |
| Bit 3           | Carry Flag (CF)           | Set for unsigned notation when there is a carry.               |
| Bit 4           | Overflow Flag (OF)        | Set for signed notation when there is an overflow.             |
