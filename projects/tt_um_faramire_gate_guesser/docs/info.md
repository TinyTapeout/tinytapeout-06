## How it works

The input and inout (used as inputs) pins are connected to 8 different logic gates, which lead to the outputs. Only one logic layer of combinatoric logic.
Each input is hooked up to only one gate.

## How to test

No clock, enable or reset is used. As this is just one layer of combinatoric logic, you can simply check against a precalculated truth table. To play, flip the inputs and observe the output until you recognise what it must be.

## External hardware

Connect 16 switches to the input and inout pins, the 8 outputs are hooked up to one LED each (or other display hardware of your choice).

The solution is (SPOILER):
- out0 = in0 and in2
- out1 = not in1
- out2 = in5 and in7 and inA
- out3 = in6 xor inC
- out4 = in4 nand in9
- out5 = in8 xnor B
- out6 = inE nor inF
- out7 = in3 or inD
