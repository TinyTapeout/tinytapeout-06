## How it works

This is a 75% implementation (the IO operations of `.` and `,` weren't implemented) of the esoteric language [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) as small factor processor.
It works as any "regular" microprocessor would, executing the given ASCII values of each character as an opcode, following this state machine:

With an internal implementation close to the following one:

## How to test

This circuit has the following pinout:
![Circuit pinout illustration](pinout.png)
To drive it, you need to have an external address register, as it requests reads/writes data in alternating cycles, some memory organization to support, at the minimum, 256 x 8 of program memory and 256 x 8 of instruction memory (this can be expanded until 1KB memories by also using the _pc_ext_ pins), and a clock, preferably at 20MHz. If you don't want for the program to access instruction memory, the pin _instr_addr_ is only set if the address being requested is for instructions, so you can use that to avoid it.

## External hardware

These are some components that you can use for interfacing with the processor:

- 256 x 8 SRAM
- 8 bits to 13 bits Register 
- 256 x 8 to 1K x 8 ROM 
- LED bars with 8 segments to show the current value exiting the processor on the data bus (_uio_out_)
