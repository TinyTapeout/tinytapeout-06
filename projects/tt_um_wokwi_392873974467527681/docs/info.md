## How it works

Based from <https://wokwi.com/projects/341279123277087315>

On power-up, the 7-segment display should display the text PILIPINASLASALLE one at a time per clock cycle. The "dp" output toggles every clock cycle.

Setting the input pin 7 to HIGH allows for manual override of the BCD value. In this mode, input pins 0-3 controls the BCD value. The text displayed for each BCD value are tabulated below:

| **in0** | **in1** | **in2** | **in3** | **Character** |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
|   LOW   |   LOW   |   LOW   |   LOW   |       P       |
|   LOW   |   LOW   |   LOW   |   HIGH  |       I       |
|   LOW   |   LOW   |   HIGH  |   LOW   |       L       |
|   LOW   |   LOW   |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |       I       |
|   LOW   |   HIGH  |   LOW   |   LOW   |       P       |
|   LOW   |   HIGH  |   LOW   |   HIGH  |       I       |
|   LOW   |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   LOW   |       N       |
|   LOW   |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |       A       |
|   HIGH  |   LOW   |   LOW   |   LOW   |       S       |
|   HIGH  |   LOW   |   LOW   |   HIGH  |       L       |
|   HIGH  |   LOW   |   HIGH  |   LOW   |       A       |
|   HIGH  |   LOW   |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |       S       |
|   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   LOW   |   LOW   |       A       |
|   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   LOW   |   HIGH  |       L       |
|   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   LOW   |       L       |
|   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |   HIGH  |       E       |

## How to test

Default mode: Set the clock input to a low frequency such as 1 Hz to see the text transition per clock cycle.

Manual mode: Set the input pin 7 to HIGH and toggle input pins 0-3. The character displayed for each input combination should be according to the table above.
