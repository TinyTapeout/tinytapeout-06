## How it works
It uses multiple logic gates to transfrom binary input to a decimal number to display in a 7 segment display

## How to test
Input any binary number between 0-9.

- 2^3=IN0 (most significant bit)
- 2^2=IN1
- 2^1=IN2
- 2^0=IN3 (least significant bit)

## External hardware
For input use a dip switch with at least 4 outputs.

For output use a single 7 segment display with common cathode.
