## How it works

This design should be able to recreate the old HP 5082-7500 display logic. This is a custom HP ASIC from the 70s, made on new silicon.

## How to test

Connect inputs to 4-bit BCD input and LEDs to output x---y

## External hardware

- BCD switch or counter
- LED dot-matrix-display.
