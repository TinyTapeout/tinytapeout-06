## How it works

Welcome, This is basically a even and odd BCD counter:-
*If input 1 is high, the even counter is on, 
*If input 2 is high, the odd counter is on. 

## How to test

We can test it by making input 1 high and connecting 7-segment display to output,
if the even count of BCD is shown, the logic circuit is cleadred the test .

## External hardware
* Push button
* 7 - segment display
