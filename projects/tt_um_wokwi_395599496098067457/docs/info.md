## How it works

Welcome, this is basically a even and odd BCD counter:

* if input 1 is high, the even counter is on
* if input 2 is high, the odd counter is on 

## How to test

We can test it by making input 1 high and connecting 7-segment display to output,
if the even count of BCD is shown, the logic circuit is cleadred the test.

## External hardware

* Push button
* 7 - segment display
