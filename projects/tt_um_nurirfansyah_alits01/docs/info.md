## How it works

The circuit is a voltage-controlled ring oscillator (VCRO) using transmission gates as the delay control element. It is based on the paper:

Retdian, N., Takagi, S., & Fujii, N. (2002). Voltage controlled ring oscillator with wide tuning range and fast voltage swing. 2002 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on ASIC, AP-ASIC 2002 - Proceedings, 201â€“204. <https://doi.org/10.1109/APASIC.2002.1031567>.

## How to test

Pinouts:

- input pins: v_control_n, v_control_p
- output pin: out

## External hardware

To test, apply control voltage v_control_n and v_control_p, where the sum of the two voltages should ideally be equal to the supply voltage of 1.8V.
