## How it works

The Verilog module implements a 8 bit binary counter with clock (`clk`), reset (`rst_n`), up count (`ui_in[2]`), down count(`ui_in[3]`), hold (`ui_in[4]`) ,output pins for binary (`out`), hexa decimal (`hex`) and decimal (`dec`). Upon a clock rising edge or reset assertion, it resets the output to 0 or increments it by 1, respectively. This design facilitates counting operations in digital systems, maintaining a 8-bit output range.

## How to test2

We test it on Vivado and open sources (OpenROAD and OpenLane).
