  description: " This Verilog module defines a synchronous 8-bit counter, where the count increments on each rising edge of the clock input (clk). Additionally, it features an asynchronous reset input (rst_n), which,0 when activated, sets the counter output (out) to zero regardless of the clock signal."
  language: "Verilog"  # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz: 50000000  # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)
  tiles: "1x1" # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM. Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
