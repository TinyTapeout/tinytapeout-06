## How it works

When the input hits a certain voltage, the output will spike and reset to a known value

E. J. Basham and D. W. Parent, "Compact digital implementation of a quadratic integrate-and-fire neuron," 2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, San Diego, CA, USA, 2012, pp. 3543-3548, doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346731.

## How to test

Input a content 8-bit digital singal when the voltage crosses the threshold, and see if it spikes.  See: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/6pjsgwxqhryaggs/ee122_lab_manual.pdf?dl=0>
