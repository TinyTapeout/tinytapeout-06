## How it works

This is a FIFO that can pass data asynchronously across clock domains. This was a project I created when I was first learning logic design, and it took me a couple weeks to settle on a design that I felt was clean and reusable.

The FIFO can hold 32 4-bit values, or 16 bytes. So use them wisely and greatly!

The original design can be found at [https://github.com/KennethWilke/sv-cdc-fifo](https://github.com/KennethWilke/sv-cdc-fifo)

The architecture of this design was influenced by
[this paper](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf)
written by Clifford E. Cummings of
[Sunburst Design](http://www.sunburst-design.com) but the implementation was fully written by me. 

## How to test

Hold `write_reset` and `read_reset` LOW while running the clock for a bit to reset, then raise to initialize the module.

### Writing to the FIFO

Prepare your data on the 4-bit `write_data` bus, ensure the `full` state is low and then raise `write_increment` for 1 cycle of `write_clock` to write data into the FIFO memory.

### Reading from the FIFO

The FIFO will present the current output on the `read_data` bus. If `empty` is low, this output should be valid and you can acknowledge receive of this vallue by raising `read_increment` for 1 cycle of `read_clock`.
