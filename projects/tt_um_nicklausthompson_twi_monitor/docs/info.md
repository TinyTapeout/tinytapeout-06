## How it works

This project is a Two-Wire Interface (I2C) monitor. The TWI side is essentially a shift register and does not respond like a slave or have an address.
The system runs at 50 MHz and uses a UART baud rate of 115,200. 
The system cannot currently capture repeated TWI frames, but captured single frames during testing on an FPGA.

## How to test

You can use an Arduino and any TWI-compatible module to generate TWI frames to view. The frames will be converted to three bytes, those being {addr, R/W}, {data}, and {{4{Addr Ack}}, {4{Data Ack}}}. I use Coolterm to view the hex output, you can download it at <https://freeware.the-meiers.org/>.

## External hardware

This project needs an external UART to USB adapter if you want to connect it to your PC.
