## How it works

This is simplified implementation of Karplus-Strong (KS) string synthesis based on papers, [Digital Synthesis of Plucked-String and Drum Timbres](https://doi.org/10.2307/3680062) and [Extensions of the Karplus-Strong Plucked-String Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.2307/3680063). 

A register map controls and configures the KS synthesis module. This register map is accessed through a SPI interface. Synthesized sound samples are sent out through the I2S transmitter interface.

## How to test

Connect a clock with frequency `f_clk = 256 kHz` and apply a reset cycle to initialize the design, this sets the audio sample rate at `fs = 16 kHz`. Use the spi register map or the `ui_in` to futher configure the design. The synthesized samples are sent continuously through the I2S transmitter interface.

## External hardware

An I2S DAC. The 8-bit signed sound samples are sent out at `f_sck = 256 kHz` through this interface.
