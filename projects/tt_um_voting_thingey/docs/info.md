## How it works
Our project used the 8 inputs as voters, expecting 1 as "FAIL" and 0 as "PASS" for votes in the system. As a default, if all systems vote for a pass, the consensus is pass. However, we also give the user the ability to customize the number of voters and the threshold of passing. 

For instnace, a user may have 8 voters and fail if 3 votes fail. 

This is for a safety system where redundant microcontrollers are used to control some safety critical hardware and we want to avoid single point faults. 

## How to test
Tested with the unit tests running `make -B` in test subfolder.
