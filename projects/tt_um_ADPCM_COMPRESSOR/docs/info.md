## How it works

This HDL block accepts a pulse density modulated (PDM) microphone signal and produces an encoded output at a lower sampling frequency while maintaining audio intelligibility.

Expected Inputs: 
- clk (clk) 
- slow_clk (ui_in[1]) for the ADPCM block at 1/8 frequency of clk
- Pulse Density Modulated input pdm_in (ui_in[2]) at clocked with clk
- block_enable (ui_in[3]) (active high): single bit enable for the entire block

Outputs:
- encPcm (uo_out[4:1]): the final 4 bit ADPCM encoded output
- outValid (uo_out[0]): Output Valid flag for the ADPCM block, goes high for one cycle of slow_clk each time a new valid adpcm value is output

## How to test

Provide two synchronized external clocks, clk and slow_clk, slow_clk a frequency 8x slower than clk (e.g. clk = 512 kHz, slow_clk = 64 khz)
Connect the data pin of a pdm microphone clocked with clk to pdm_in.
Intially set block_enable to low, then when recording/compression should begin, set block_enable to high.
Now, a CIC decimated and ADPCM encoded output of the microphone data will stream from encPcm, which can be stored to memory, or decoded for writing to an audio file or playback.
