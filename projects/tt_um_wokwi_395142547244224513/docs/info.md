## How it works

Wokwi project uses a D flip-flop ring to display "EFAB" on the 7-segment display.

## How to test

Works best with a slow clock (say, 2~10Hz) or manually stepping with the demo board's "step" button.

Turn off all input switches, then power on the board. Expect to see "F" blinking on the display with each clock pulse.

Switch on input switch 3, and "E" should start blinking.

Switch on input switch 1, and it should cycle through "EFAb".

Switch on input switch 8, and letter blinking should be disabled.

These are the inputs:

| In  | Signal | Function                           |
|-----|--------|------------------------------------|
| SW1 | `IN0`  | **Run**: Off = Reset; On = Run     |
| SW2 | `IN1`  | (Unused)                           |
| SW3 | `IN2`  | `state_init[0]`; Normally ON       |
| SW4 | `IN3`  | `state_init[1]`; Normally off      |
| SW5 | `IN4`  | `state_init[2]`; Normally off      |
| SW6 | `IN5`  | `state_init[3]`; Normally off      |
| SW7 | `IN6`  | (Unused)                           |
| SW8 | `IN7`  | **Blink control**: On = no blink   |

`state_init` specifies the initial state for the sequencing
flip-flops during reset, and for normal operation the first (SW3)
would be switched ON, and the other three (SW4..6) would be
switched off.
