## How it works

This circuit is a simple pipelined multiply and accumulate unit to compute a*b+c using SpinalHDL as a generator. 

It uses the classic textbook method of multiplication with base 2. So if the numbers a and b 
are multiplied, the sum of the version of argument a shifted to the left by i bits must be summed up 
if and only if the ith bit of b is 1.

These bit products, i.e. (a << i) * b(i), are determined in the individual stages of the pipeline 
and the result is calculated step by step.

## How to test

Simply feed a, b, and c as 4 bit unsigned integer into the unit. The latency is 3 clocks, hence the
(hopefully correct) answer can be found at the result output after 3 cycles.
