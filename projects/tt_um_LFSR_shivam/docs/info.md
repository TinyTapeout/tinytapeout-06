## How it works

This Verilog module defines a 10-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It features clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) input pins. The output pin (`out`) delivers a pseudo-random sequence based on clock edges and reset conditions. It's designed for digital applications requiring pseudo-random sequence generation and pattern generation.


## How to test

We test it on Vivado and open sources (OpenROAD and OpenLane).
