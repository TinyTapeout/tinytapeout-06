## How it works

This is a an implementation of a classic systolic array multiplier with uart interface. 

This implementation can multiply 2x2 matrix by another 2x2 matrix. The calculations are done in float16.

## How to Test

1. **Initialization Sequence**: Begin by sending the initialization sequence `11111110` to the device. This sequence prepares the device to start receiving data for matrix multiplication.

2. **Sending Matrix Data**:
    - You will need to send the elements of the two matrices you wish to multiply. Each matrix element is a float16 number, which must be transmitted as two separate 8-bit frames (high byte first).
    - Since you are multiplying 2x2 matrices, you must send a total of 8 float16 numbers, equating to 16 data frames of 8 bits each.
    - For clarity, send the matrix elements in row-major order. For example, if your matrices are A and B, with elements `a11, a12, a21, a22` for A and similarly for B, send them in the order `a11, a12, a21, a22, b11, b12, b21, b22`.

3. **Receiving the Result**:
    - Upon completion of the data processing, the device will first send back an acknowledgment sequence `11111110`, indicating that the multiplication process is complete and the device is about to send the result.
    - Following this, expect to receive the result of the matrix multiplication in a similar format to the input. The device will send 4 float16 numbers (representing the resulting matrix elements) as 8-bit frames (high byte first), which you will need to interpret accordingly.

4. **Interpreting the Results**:
    - Collect the 8-bit frames received from the device and reconstruct them into float16 numbers to obtain the resulting matrix elements.
    - These elements represent the resultant matrix from the multiplication of the two input matrices.
