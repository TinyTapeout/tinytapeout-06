## How it works

The design implements a moving average filter using a series of registers and a finite state machine (FSM). 
The filter calculates the average of a set of recent values in a data stream, determined by the FILTER_POWER parameter. 
This smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends or cycles.
The master module handles input and output processing, including bidirectional IO handling and filter selection based on input control signals.

## How to test

To test the moving average filter, provide a series of digital input values to the 'ui_in' port and observe the smoothed output on 'uo_out'. 
The 'uio_in' can be used to control the filter's width and operational parameters. 
Test with varying input patterns and filter widths to evaluate the filter's response.
