## How it works

This is an 8-channel PWM controller for LED brightness.

The PWM duty cycle is generated according to an X^3 curve, so the 
"percieved brightness" changes linearly with the register
setting. This design means we get the dynamic range of a 16-bit PWM but
use only 8 bits to specify the desired output. With an input clock of 32.7
MHz, the PWM frequency is 500 Hz.

After reset, the controller is in UI mode, where the ui[7:0] set the 8 PWM
value registers. The first PWM value register is set to ui[7:0], for the 
remaining PWM value registers they are set to 0 when ui[7:0] == 0, but in
other cases their value is ui[7:0] XOR X, where X is 0x10 times the register
number.

The individual registers can be accessed by I2C; SCL=UIO2, SDA=UIO1, which
should allow accessing it from the Rpi2040 on the demo board. The slave 
address is 0x6C, and the 8 PWM channels are controlled by register addresses
0 thru 7. As soon as the first I2C write occurs, the controller is set to
I2C mode, and the ui inputs no longer affect the registers.

## How to test

Play with the DIP-switches to see different segments of the 7-segment LED
display show different brightnesses.
