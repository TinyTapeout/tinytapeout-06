## How it works

two four-bit || binary weighted vectors are read in and converted to two 1-bit serial stochastic streams with a PRBS and a comparator.  These signals are then fed into an AND gate, which multiplies the signal.

## How to test

Use an ADLAM2000 and Python to control the reset and the clock. Hold A and B contents and watch the multiplier output. Use the DALM200 and Python to convert the signal back to binary weight signals.  The number of ones at any given time is the number
