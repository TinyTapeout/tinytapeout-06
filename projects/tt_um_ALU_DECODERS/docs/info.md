## How it works
This is a pure combinational design.
This is a simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) whose output is connected to two different decorders, an Octal decoder for two 7 segments displays and an Gray decoder for the same two 7 segments displays. The output displays will show the result of the operations between two 3 bit numbers according to Sel_A_in and Sel_M_in.

The Sel_A_in has the following operations according to its value.
- Sel_A_in = 2'b00 , the ALU will be set in substraction. Num_A_in - Num_B_in.
- Sel_A_in = 2'b01 , the ALU will be set in Adition. Num_A_in + Num_B_in.
- Sel_A_in = 2'b10 , the ALU will be set in XOR. Num_A_in ^ Num_B_in.
- Sel_A_in = 2'b11 , the ALU will be set in AND. Num_A_in & Num_B_in.

The Sel_M_in has the following operations.
- Sel_M_in = 1'b0 , The output will be displayed in the octal system as the multiplexer selects the output of the Octal Decoder.
- Sel_M_in = 1'b1 , The output will be displayed in the Gray system as the multiplexer selects the output of the Gray Decoder.

Note: The Gray Decoder has been specially decoded to be shown in a decimal system for the 7 segments displays.

## How to test

In order to test this device, you will need to input the numbers to the pin where Num_A_in and Num_B_in are located, this values go from 0 =3'b000 up to 7 = 3'b111. From this point forward modify the correponding bits on the correspondent selectors based on list displayed in How it works and see the result on the 7 segment displays (External).

## External hardware

For external hardware you'll need:
- An external DC power source.
- 14 330 ohms resistors.
- 2 7 segments displays common cathode.
