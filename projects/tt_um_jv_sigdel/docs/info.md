## How it works

A 1st order passive sigma delta modulator can be realized by attaching R1, R2 and C to a digital input.

## How to test

Add the RC network and apply a DC voltage at the input in0 and out5.
Select sampling, oversamplingrate and filter in1..6.
The 4 output lines 0..3 should give a 4-Bit value.
The out6,7 give a pwm signal changing with the input voltage.

All subcircuits were tested in one testfile tb_sigdel do be able to observe all signals.

## BASYS3 board measurements

22k resistors were used with 100 and 560 pF capacitances.

The signals at the capacitor and the digital signal inx were measured 
with an Electronic Explorer board.

Measurement showed a missing enable signal for inx sampling.

The table shows valid configuration options.

A better configuration scheme should be chosen in the next design.<br>
Higher fsCLK have lower capacitance.

A better multiplexing to the 4 Bit output with a case statement was done at the FPGA
and the routing of out[3:0] done to led[3:0].

## Summary

It is possible with this circuit to look at the influence of R, C and 
oversampling on the accuracy of a 1st order sigma delta ADC.

Bad R,C values can cause non linearities or signal limitation to VDD and ground.

The order of the SINC filter can lead to less resolution (SNR) than expected.

The order of the SINC filter should be at least one more than the sigma delta modulator.

The pwm signal has 10 bits and can be used for more precise output values.
