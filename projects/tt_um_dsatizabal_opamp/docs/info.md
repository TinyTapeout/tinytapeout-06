This is the implementation of a simple Operational Amplifier (OpAmp) buit with FET from the Sky130 PDK. The design is based on [Diego's and Julia's design from Fulgor Foundation](https://github.com/diegohernando/caravel_fulgor_opamp/tree/master/xschem).

## How it works

Basically works as an OpAmp, that is, a high-impedance high-gain on open-loop amplifier block, without feedback loop acts as a comparator, with feedback loop may work as inverting and non-inverting amplifier with gain setteable with feedback network as with any OpAmp like LM317, not too much more to add here.

## Internal schematics

The following is a capture of Xschem of the internals of OpAmp:

### A note on the R1/R2 network:

This is to generate a virtual ground and provide a negative voltage as VDD. In TinyTapeout 6 the only available power is 1.8 VDC referenced to a ground, for the OpAmp we considered convenient to have a negative voltage, so we implemented this network in a way that the external signal ground (ZREF) be the reference ground and the actual power ground became a -0.9 Volts point from the OpAmp point of view.

## Magic Layout

Next we show a view of the Layout created in Magic for the OpAmp cell only:

The OpAmp cell integrated with TinyTapeout top cell shows less detail and is shown as reference:

## How to test

Two testbenches are included for the OpAmp: a [Non-Inverting amplifier](../xschem/opamp_tb.sch) and an [Inverting amplifier](../xschem/opamp_inv_tb.sch) 

To test the Operational Amplifier any of those circuits, that are very easy to setup, can be utilized and check the corresponding output gains.

/!\\ Beware that the input signal ground (Vin) must not be connected to the same ground as Chip power, it must be connected to ZREF pin. /!\\

/!\\ Observe that output signal will have a DC offset due to the use of a virtual ground inside the OpAmp. /!\\

## External hardware

Power source, resistors, signal generator, oscilloscope.
