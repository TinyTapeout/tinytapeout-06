## How it works

Simple NCO to generate a sine, square or sawtooth output.
Sine wave is generated from a table and square and sawtooth from the phase accumulator.
Note: Output is unsigned 8bit.

## How to test

Modeselection is done with the uio[1:0]:

- 0: NONE, output is 0
- 1: SINE
- 2: SQUARE
- 3: SAWTOOTH

Frequency word is 16bit and is given as split into upper and lower part. Lower part is given with by 
uio[2]='1' and ui[7:0]=word and the upper part by uio[3]='1' and ui[7:0]=word.
