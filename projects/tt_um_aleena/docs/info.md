## How it works

ReLu and sigmoid activation functions are included

For ReLu: The output is same as the input value if it is positive and zero otherwise.

For Sigmoid: Used for binary classification and predict the probability as output.

## External hardware

A voltage source at analog pin 1 and analog pin 4 which is an output of an ANN
