## How it works

I'm designing a minimal GPU, which is a large project and also challenging to connect with the tt06 pins. Rather than try to wrangle with this setup and buy up a bunch of tiles, I figured I would put together something simple so I can get the peace of mind of having a submission!

I'll still be shipping my GPU project, which I'll add a link to here soon - but for tapeout I didn't want to block on that.

## How to test

The test bench is quite simple - just testing the addition function of the ALU.
